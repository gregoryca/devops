This DevOps repository is a collection of ansible, terraform and docker compose/kubernetes all wrapped up in a single repository
With this repository you will be able to do the following:

Manage:
    docker/proxmox and many more appliances using ansible and terraform
Create:
    docker/proxmox containers, proxmox vm's and many more appliances using ansible and terraform
Delete:
    docker/proxmox containers, proxmox vm's and many more appliances using ansible and terraform

this repository contains:
    ansible,
    terraform and
    docker compose code

The structure is as follows:
    ansible:
        inventory: holds all the variable values
        task file: contains all the actions that are performed on the host
    terraform:
        modules: code to interact with transip or the proxmox server
        variables: variables that are used in the variables file
        terraform.tfvars: variable values, used in the deployment
    docker compose:
        docker compose stack that is launched or updated

This repository uses a few files to hold the variable data like:
    inventory
    terraform.tfvars
This is done, so it's easier to work with other frameworks by creating the neccesary files on runtime !
For example: after an proxmox deployment using terraform, you could capture the vm details, and create an inventory file for ansible.

When ansible is ran to configure the VM, it already has all the neccasary information (as a ansible inventory file) to do it's work.
